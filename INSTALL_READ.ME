INSTALLATION NOTES:
------------------

[a]
Use this MAVEN-project to build a 'blacklab-sru-server.war' file and put this file in the Tomcat webapps folder (or like)

[b]
The application needs some configuration files. 
It expects those files to be in the Tomcat webapps folder as well, t.i. in a subfolder called 'blacklab-sru-server-config'.
An example of such a config folder can be found in the 'doc' folder of this project.
